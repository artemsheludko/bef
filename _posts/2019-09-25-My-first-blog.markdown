Hi, my name is Parthkumar Patel, but I go by Parth or Pi. It is with a lot of excitement. I am writing this blog. It has always been a wish to start sharing my thoughts on some platforms. Well, I have accounts on Youtube and Twitch for gaming and education tutorials but nothing I can share my everyday unusual or stupid thoughts with the world. As I was designing and editing this web layout, I downloaded from Jekyll. I was wondering is it even worth it to spend time creating this page and then losing the motivation to post? So to answer that question, I said to myself I will make at least 25 posts by the end of 2019. And this is post number 1. 

I am not sure how far the reach of my audience is going to be, so let me introduce my life to you. I am a senior year student at Rutgers University-NB majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am an Indian who is brought up in Qatar. It is always confusing to explain it to someone when they ask me where are you from? Because it is not a simple answer. I was born in India and lived in India for four years of my life then my family moved to Oman because my dad got a job in Oman. However, he was on contract for three years but by the end of the 2nd year; he found a job in Qatar which was permanent and well the rest is history. So I have lived in Qatar for most of my life. 

I already mentioned my father so let me give a quick mention of my other family members. I grew up with my loving parents and a younger brother. I am more than blessed to have a family that is this loving and nurturing from the day I was born. It is always exciting to see them when I go back to Qatar after my semester. The most loved member of my family is Rocky, our 4-year-old German shepherd. There was no way we could have a dog in our house for some reason, and it was far from imaginable that we would ever have a dog before I graduated high school, but that's a story for another time. So my family consists of the five of us!!

This being the first post I don't want to include a lot of details but just a few things as mentioned above for you to know me a tiny bit better. I have a lot of hobbies, like photography, gaming, and editing videos to create meme content. Making other people laugh is my priority in life.

You will get to know me more from my future posts. Let me explain what I am going to post here on this webpage. So I wanted to post my everyday thoughts, but I also wanted to have a way to explain the projects I work on in my day to day student life if you like my thoughts blogs more than my project blogs (which can be technical then feel free to skip those). 

If you have reached this far I thank you so much for reading my first blog and cheers to many more!!!
